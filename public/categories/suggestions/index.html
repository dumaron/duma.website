<p>
    This is an article written by <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky" target="_blank">Tonsky</a> about polishing UIs.
</p>
<p>
    He starts from an (honestly already good) UI taken from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a> 
    and with some simple techniques he makes it even better. The most prominent technique is overlapping the UI with a grid to 
    show the little imperfections present.
</p>
<p>
    This simple technique can spot imbalances in many interfaces and doesn't require much effort. While not all the
    adjustments he made are wise if used in a web/responsive context, most of them are.
</p>
<p>
    That's also easy to take UIs and applying them grid as an exercise to improve order and balance inside our works. For instance,
    if you put a grid over this blog at this moment, the result is a complete mess.. maybe I need to do some something like this.

    Directed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gary_hustwit" target="_blank">Gary Hustwit</a>, released in 2007, watched by me last week.
</p>
<p>
    The documentary is pleasant and includes a lot of interviews that are useful ever for who is just superficially interested in typography - like me.
</p>
<p>
    The most interesting part, in my opinion, is where the different phases of typography's evolution are abstracted into specific 
    categories - modernism, "grunge typography", neo modernism... and so on. I've never thought about it in this way but, once these terms 
    are described by the interviews, they help us to navigate in the sea of different fonts and styles around us.
</p>
<p>
    There's also <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/helvetica3/422956530?autoplay=1" target="_blank">a bonus track</a> - long as much as the film itself - and other films by Hustwit - like 
    <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/urbanized" target="_blank">Urbanized</a> or 
    <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/rams" target="_blank">Rams</a> - which seems pretty cool. 
    Make sure to give a look at <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/" target="_blank">his website</a>.

    Usually, I don't like sites promoted by <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards</a>.<br />
    I often expect to be mesmerized by the beautiful effects and the non-ordinary interactivity and I end up finding
    them slow and counterintuitive.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.powerhouse-company.com/" target="_blank">Powerhouse company</a> is an exception.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/powerhouse-company-wins-site-of-the-month-april-2020.html"
        target="_blank">Awwwards "Site of the month" in April 2020</a>,
    it expresses a rare balance between graphic effects and intuitiveness.
</p>
<p>
    The Awwwards article says many things, I'll add here only a few points:
    <ul>
        <li>the effects' parameters must be well-tuned, resulting in a smooth experience, fluid and not
            cumbersome;</li>
        <li>its system of navigation is unorthodox but intuitive, <strong>making the site exploration funny</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>the site is built around <strong>content</strong>, instead of focusing on graphic effects.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There are a few pain points in my opinion:
    <ul>
        <li>navigation by keys (pageUp, pageDown, end..) is disabled, making it more difficult to watch for PC users;
        </li>
        <li>the effects on the homepage are not so smooth.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p></p>
Apart from this, the overall experience is very pleasant. Even the micro-interactions are cured maniacally, like the
example of the close button with plus an indicator of the scroll level.
