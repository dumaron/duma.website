      <description>Wrong direction I had the opportunity to work for many small and medium companies.
Most of them weren&amp;rsquo;t software house. Most of them weren&amp;rsquo;t up to date with all the technologies of javascript&amp;rsquo;s world. Typescript, Angular, and React were like echoes of distant mermaids: attractive yet too far to make the boat change direction.
I think that, startups excluded, most companies still fall under this description today. Their softwares are &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; web application written in javascript v5, jQuery and, God forbid, Bootstrap 3.</description>
