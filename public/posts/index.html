<p>
    This is an article written by <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky" target="_blank">Tonsky</a> about polishing UIs.
</p>
<p>
    He starts from an (honestly already good) UI taken from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a> 
    and with some simple techniques he makes it even better. The most prominent technique is overlapping the UI with a grid to 
    show the little imperfections present.
</p>
<p>
    This simple technique can spot imbalances in many interfaces and doesn't require much effort. While not all the
    adjustments he made are wise if used in a web/responsive context, most of them are.
</p>
<p>
    That's also easy to take UIs and applying them grid as an exercise to improve order and balance inside our works. For instance,
    if you put a grid over this blog at this moment, the result is a complete mess.. maybe I need to do some something like this.

    Directed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gary_hustwit" target="_blank">Gary Hustwit</a>, released in 2007, watched by me last week.
</p>
<p>
    The documentary is pleasant and includes a lot of interviews that are useful ever for who is just superficially interested in typography - like me.
</p>
<p>
    The most interesting part, in my opinion, is where the different phases of typography's evolution are abstracted into specific 
    categories - modernism, "grunge typography", neo modernism... and so on. I've never thought about it in this way but, once these terms 
    are described by the interviews, they help us to navigate in the sea of different fonts and styles around us.
</p>
<p>
    There's also <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/helvetica3/422956530?autoplay=1" target="_blank">a bonus track</a> - long as much as the film itself - and other films by Hustwit - like 
    <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/urbanized" target="_blank">Urbanized</a> or 
    <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/rams" target="_blank">Rams</a> - which seems pretty cool.

<p>
    Usually, I don't like sites promoted by <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards</a>.<br />
    I often expect to be mesmerized by the beautiful effects and the non-ordinary interactivity and I end up finding
    them slow and counterintuitive.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.powerhouse-company.com/" target="_blank">Powerhouse company</a> is an exception.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/powerhouse-company-wins-site-of-the-month-april-2020.html"
        target="_blank">Awwwards "Site of the month" in April 2020</a>,
    it expresses a rare balance between graphic effects and intuitiveness.
</p>
<p>
    The Awwwards article says many things, I'll add here only a few points:
    <ul>
        <li>the effects' parameters must be well-tuned, resulting in a smooth experience, fluid and not
            cumbersome;</li>
        <li>its system of navigation is unorthodox but intuitive, <strong>making the site exploration funny</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>the site is built around <strong>content</strong>, instead of focusing on graphic effects.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There are a few pain points in my opinion:
    <ul>
        <li>navigation by keys (pageUp, pageDown, end..) is disabled, making it more difficult to watch for PC users;
        </li>
        <li>the effects on the homepage are not so smooth.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p></p>
Apart from this, the overall experience is very pleasant. Even the micro-interactions are cured maniacally, like the
example of the close button with plus an indicator of the scroll level.

<h2 id="wrong-direction">Wrong direction</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity to work for many small and medium companies.</p>
<p>Most of them weren&rsquo;t software house. Most of them weren&rsquo;t up to date with all the technologies of javascript&rsquo;s world. Typescript, Angular, and React were like echoes of distant mermaids: attractive yet too far to make the boat change direction.</p>
<p>I think that, startups excluded, most companies still fall under this description today. Their softwares are &ldquo;old&rdquo; web application written in javascript v5, jQuery and, God forbid, Bootstrap 3.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as time goes on, the need for a rewrite becomes more impellent. The feature requests start to accumulate, the graphics already looked old 5 years ago, there isn&rsquo;t enough drag&rsquo;n&rsquo;drop all around.. and so on. In this context, the frontend developers might wonder if it&rsquo;s the right chance to adopt one of the new technologies to improve their software.</p>
<p>My opinion is that, oftentimes, that&rsquo;s a bad choice. The aspect where the software is lacking is not technology, but usability.</p>
<h2 id="switch-context">Switch context</h2>
<p>The book &ldquo;The Psychology of Everyday Things&rdquo; by Donald Norman was published more than 30 years ago. Nonetheless, its fundamental concepts remain completely obscure to most programmers today.</p>
<p>The examples he makes in the first chapter of the new edition are so true that somehow hurts. UX experts are born exactly to fill this hole in the developers&rsquo; knowledge; this doesn&rsquo;t justify a complete ignorance of these concepts by any developer that has to build a graphic interface. It&rsquo;s like being a translator and knowing only one of the two or more languages involved.</p>
<p>A bit of knowledge of how human beings &ldquo;work&rdquo; and how interfaces can talk to them can dramatically improve your user&rsquo;s life - and indirectly yours. By overcoming the natural reluctance to work with &ldquo;human stuff&rdquo; a new class of enhancements becomes available.</p>
<p>These changes often don&rsquo;t need a complete rewrite of the application and can also remove some of the worst user&rsquo;s pain points. A developer can&rsquo;t improvise himself as a UX expert, but that&rsquo;s not required: even a little knowledge of usability can dramatically improve your user&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>These changes, paired with a graphical revamp, are what users and boss really need - even if they don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<h2 id="know-what-you-lose">Know what you lose</h2>
<p>New technologies are seductive but with great power comes great responsibility. By embracing modern javascript frameworks there are many aspects of the user interface that needs to be handled manually.</p>
<p>The best example is content loading. With a server-side rendering system, an HTML page is sent complete to the browsers. With modern SPAs it&rsquo;s not uncommon to have different components that make different requests and have their loadings. This new situation, without proper handling, can lead to interfaces that &ldquo;pops&rdquo; and flicker.
Their handling it&rsquo;s up to the same developer that has no knowledge of usability (no talk about graphic design).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon that a new frontend technology leads to worse user experience. Sadly this knowledge comes only after experience, failures, and a more complete understanding of the chosen framework.</p>
<p>So, if I can spare you some suffering, my advice is: learn things about humans. Do it before thinking about adopting a new technology. &ldquo;The design of everyday things&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think&rdquo; are good books and can help you understand that, maybe, your problem it&rsquo;s not technology.</p>
