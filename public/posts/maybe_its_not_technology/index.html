<h2 id="wrong-direction">Wrong direction</h2>
<p>I had the opportunity to work for many small and medium companies.</p>
<p>Most of them weren&rsquo;t software house. Most of them weren&rsquo;t up to date with all the technologies of javascript&rsquo;s world. Typescript, Angular, and React were like echoes of distant mermaids: attractive yet too far to make the boat change direction.</p>
<p>I think that, startups excluded, most companies still fall under this description today. Their softwares are &ldquo;old&rdquo; web application written in javascript v5, jQuery and, God forbid, Bootstrap 3.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as time goes on, the need for a rewrite becomes more impellent. The feature requests start to accumulate, the graphics already looked old 5 years ago, there isn&rsquo;t enough drag&rsquo;n&rsquo;drop all around.. and so on. In this context, the frontend developers might wonder if it&rsquo;s the right chance to adopt one of the new technologies to improve their software.</p>
<p>My opinion is that, oftentimes, that&rsquo;s a bad choice. The aspect where the software is lacking is not technology, but usability.</p>
<h2 id="switch-context">Switch context</h2>
<p>The book &ldquo;The Psychology of Everyday Things&rdquo; by Donald Norman was published more than 30 years ago. Nonetheless, its fundamental concepts remain completely obscure to most programmers today.</p>
<p>The examples he makes in the first chapter of the new edition are so true that somehow hurts. UX experts are born exactly to fill this hole in the developers&rsquo; knowledge; this doesn&rsquo;t justify a complete ignorance of these concepts by any developer that has to build a graphic interface. It&rsquo;s like being a translator and knowing only one of the two or more languages involved.</p>
<p>A bit of knowledge of how human beings &ldquo;work&rdquo; and how interfaces can talk to them can dramatically improve your user&rsquo;s life - and indirectly yours. By overcoming the natural reluctance to work with &ldquo;human stuff&rdquo; a new class of enhancements becomes available.</p>
<p>These changes often don&rsquo;t need a complete rewrite of the application and can also remove some of the worst user&rsquo;s pain points. A developer can&rsquo;t improvise himself as a UX expert, but that&rsquo;s not required: even a little knowledge of usability can dramatically improve your user&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>These changes, paired with a graphical revamp, are what users and boss really need - even if they don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>
<h2 id="know-what-you-lose">Know what you lose</h2>
<p>New technologies are seductive but with great power comes great responsibility. By embracing modern javascript frameworks there are many aspects of the user interface that needs to be handled manually.</p>
<p>The best example is content loading. With a server-side rendering system, an HTML page is sent complete to the browsers. With modern SPAs it&rsquo;s not uncommon to have different components that make different requests and have their loadings. This new situation, without proper handling, can lead to interfaces that &ldquo;pops&rdquo; and flicker.
Their handling it&rsquo;s up to the same developer that has no knowledge of usability (no talk about graphic design).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon that a new frontend technology leads to worse user experience. Sadly this knowledge comes only after experience, failures, and a more complete understanding of the chosen framework.</p>
<p>So, if I can spare you some suffering, my advice is: learn things about humans. Do it before thinking about adopting a new technology. &ldquo;The design of everyday things&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me think&rdquo; are good books and can help you understand that, maybe, your problem it&rsquo;s not technology.</p>
