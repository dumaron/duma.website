<p>
    Usually, I don't like sites promoted by <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/" target="_blank">Awwwards</a>.<br />
    I often expect to be mesmerized by the beautiful effects and the non-ordinary interactivity and I end up finding
    them slow and counterintuitive.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.powerhouse-company.com/" target="_blank">Powerhouse company</a> is an exception.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/powerhouse-company-wins-site-of-the-month-april-2020.html"
        target="_blank">Awwwards "Site of the month" in April 2020</a>,
    it expresses a rare balance between graphic effects and intuitiveness.
</p>
<p>
    The Awwwards article says many things, I'll add here only a few points:
    <ul>
        <li>the effects' parameters must be well-tuned, resulting in a smooth experience, fluid and not
            cumbersome;</li>
        <li>its system of navigation is unorthodox but intuitive, <strong>making the site exploration funny</strong>;
        </li>
        <li>the site is built around <strong>content</strong>, instead of focusing on graphic effects.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    There are a few pain points in my opinion:
    <ul>
        <li>navigation by keys (pageUp, pageDown, end..) is disabled, making it more difficult to watch for PC users;
        </li>
        <li>the effects on the homepage are not so smooth.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p></p>
Apart from this, the overall experience is very pleasant. Even the micro-interactions are cured maniacally, like the
example of the close button with plus an indicator of the scroll level.

    I hope to build something like this in the future.
