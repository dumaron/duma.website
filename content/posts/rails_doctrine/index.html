    I found <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/" target="_blank">the Rails Doctrine page</a> while watching 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiR9viVIJgo" target="_blank">this video from Sam Selikoff</a>. 
    The video itself is very interesting, give it a look if you're struggling daily with react - like me.
</p>
<p>
    Back to the RoR Doctrine page: it's superb.
</p>
<p>
    I already knew many of the concepts expressed in it. The conceptual battle between frameworks "a la Rails" 
    and unopinionated frameworks (or even libraries) is not new to everyone who has been in web development in the last 10 years.
    But this text resumes all the things that I want to say about the tools I'm using during my job. 
</p>
<p>
    <em>It expresses a way to look at programming languages and frameworks as tools; tools that
    must bend to the developer in order to create things and let he/she enjoy his own creations</em>.
    This contrast to the tendency of some developer to lock themselves in a labyrinth by
    thinking more on "how to do things", instead of focusing on the final products.
</p>
<p>
    It also focuses on the limits of "reinventing the wheel" every time by showing the importance
    of hiding problems already resolved a long ago by the community. It's incredible how many
    programmers - at least in the javascript context - want to give solution to a problem that
    probably has been resolved already dozens of times, probably years ago.
</p>
<p>
    Shared experience, intended as a collective way to learn and progress towards the future,
    if often neglected in favor of building the same thing again and again - probably making
    the same mistakes the other developer has already made, making you waste time and money.
</p>
<p>
    But I'm getting off-topic; probably I'll write something in the future. 
    Meanwhile, I strongly suggest you to read the page.
