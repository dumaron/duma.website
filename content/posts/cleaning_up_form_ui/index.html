    This is an article written by <a href="https://twitter.com/nikitonsky" target="_blank">Tonsky</a> about polishing UIs.
</p>
<p>
    He starts from an (honestly already good) UI taken from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a> 
    and with some simple techniques he makes it even better. The most prominent technique is overlapping the UI with a grid to 
    show the little imperfections present.
</p>
<p>
    This simple technique can spot imbalances in many interfaces and doesn't require much effort. While not all the
    adjustments he made are wise if used in a web/responsive context, most of them are.
</p>
<p>
    That's also easy to take UIs and applying them grid as an exercise to improve order and balance inside our works. For instance,
    if you put a grid over this blog at this moment, the result is a complete mess.. maybe I need to do some something like this.
