    Directed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gary_hustwit" target="_blank">Gary Hustwit</a>, released in 2007, watched by me last week.

<p>
    The documentary is pleasant and includes a lot of interviews that are useful ever for who is just superficially interested in typography - like me.
</p>
<p>
    The most interesting part, in my opinion, is where the different phases of typography's evolution are abstracted into specific 
    categories - modernism, "grunge typography", neo modernism... and so on. I've never thought about it in this way but, once these terms 
    are described by the interviews, they help us to navigate in the sea of different fonts and styles around us.

    There's also <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/helvetica3/422956530?autoplay=1" target="_blank">a bonus track</a> - long as much as the film itself - and other films by Hustwit - like 
    <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/urbanized" target="_blank">Urbanized</a> or 
    <a href="https://www.hustwit.com/rams" target="_blank">Rams</a> - which seems pretty cool.
